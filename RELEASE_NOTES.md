## What's New in v1.3.2

### Improvements
- **Version display in app header** — the current version is now shown in the top-right corner of the app (subtle monospace text) so users always know which version they are running
- **Version in window title** — the title bar now reads `VideoBook Forge v1.3.2` instead of the generic app name
