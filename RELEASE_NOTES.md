## What's New in v1.3.3

### New Features
- **New app icon** — updated branding with a new anvil + book logo across the window title bar, taskbar, installer, and desktop shortcut

### Improvements
- **Export Settings redesigned** — two-column layout now fills the full window width instead of leaving an empty sidebar; settings on the left, resolution + summary on the right
- **Burn-in subtitle option always visible** — the subtitle burn-in toggle now correctly appears on the Export Settings step even when AI subtitles were auto-selected rather than manually chosen
- **Auto-select AI moved earlier** — subtitle source auto-selection now happens on the Export Settings step instead of the Convert step, so burn-in preference can be set before conversion begins

### Bug Fixes
- **OS title bar** — app icon now correctly displays the new logo instead of Electron's default icon
